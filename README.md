# Similarity-Search-with-Word-Embeddings
Similarity Search with Word Embeddings is an NLP technique to measure similarity between words, phrases, or documents. It represents text as dense vectors using models like Word2Vec, GloVe and calculates similarity using metrics like cosine similarity. This is used in search engines, recommendation systems, and text clustering to improve accuracy.
