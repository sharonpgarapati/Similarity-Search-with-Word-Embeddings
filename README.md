# Similarity-Search-with-Word-Embeddings
Similarity Search with Word Embeddings is an NLP technique to measure similarity between words, phrases, or documents. It represents text as dense vectors using models like Word2Vec, GloVe and calculates similarity using metrics like cosine similarity. This is used in search engines, recommendation systems, and text clustering to improve accuracy.


It is a console-based application builds a similarity search system for word embeddings
from a user specified text file or URL to find and compare semantic similarities between
words. Utilizing pre-trained word embeddings, the system enables users to perform
various similarity calculations such as cosine similarity, dot product, and Euclidean
distance.

It supports:
 Loading and managing word embeddings: Import embeddings from a file to
represent words as high-dimensional vectors.
 Searching for similar words: Retrieve words most similar to a given word based
on specified distance metrics.
 Mathematical operations with word vectors: Perform vector arithmetic
(addition and subtraction) on word embeddings to explore semantic
relationships.
 Console-based interaction: Users interact with the system through a
command-line interface, selecting options, inputting text and viewing results.
Users interact with the application through a command line interface to configure
settings, input words, and obtain similarity results making it a practical tool for
exploring semantic connections in natural language processing.


To Run

From console at .jar file directory:
Then open the ./SimilaritySearchWithWordEmbeddings.jar
Then open the source,
then open the package ie.atu.sw
and then navigate through console options to set the following files to be used.
1. SimilarityCalculator .java
2. FileHandler.java
3. DistanceCalculator.java
4. ConsoleColour.java and
5. Runner.java

When a program is run from the runner.java file, a menu appears on the console.
All required functions can be performed using this menu and following the instructions
in each step
